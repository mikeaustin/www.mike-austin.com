Status: "iffy"
Status: updated; doesn't current enable nifty coroutine based animations
  as the coroutines are very unstable. Not much glitz currently, but it
  plays.

Create words by swapping two adjacent letters (up or down, not
diagonally).  Swap letters by clicking on the two letters to
swap.

Once your letters are all in order to form a word, click the first
letter and then the last letter of the word. If the word is found in the
dictionary, it is scored and the letters replaced with random letters.

Repeat until time runs out in the level. You must create a certain
number of words to pass to the next level.

Each word is scored based on the number of letters used.
Note! Words must be at least 3 letters long!

At higher levels, letters will sometimes swap themselves with a
neighbor, possibly ruining your words as you arrange them!

Good luck!
