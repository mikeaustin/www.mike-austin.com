Sticky Windows
--------------
 - Since a Window can't have multiple parents, set the parent of a sticky
   window when switching desktops

Goals
-----
Lightweight
Simple API
Properties
Models/Events
Live Designing

ToDo
----
- Make label text and attribute
x Move window texture update before drawing routines
- Label should resize width for text
- Move mouse grab to function
x Move gl calls to graphics
- GenericModel - Name, Type
- CloseButton should reference window var, not parent
- Visual.contextMenu
- do() that knows outer scope
- Desktop switching tabs
x Graphics vertex(), color(), begin()
x Window sizing is getting invalidated
  invalidate() being called within drawing method?
  Font drawString produces the error
  Real problem is that invalidate() starves glutPostRedisplay()
- Add tracing capability without overhead?
- Add window shadows
x Add chinese checkers game in a Window
- init gets called when 'subclassing'
  That's how prototypes work, but it causes race conditions


import = doFile
using = appendProto

ChinaVisual
ChinaApp

Each app gets it's own namespace

Object clone doFile( "China.io" )



ChinaApp.io

appendProto( Inertia )
