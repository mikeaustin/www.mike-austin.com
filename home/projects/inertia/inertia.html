<h3>What is Inertia?</h3>
<ul>
  Inertia is a programming language that has been brewing in my head for a few 
  years now. It's a language based on objects, blocks (closures) and messages, 
  with syntax and semantics borrowed from several languages -- refactored and 
  stripped of extraneous symbols and other artifacts. There is nothing yet to 
  download, I've only constructed prototypes and test implementations. 
  <p>Inertia's main goals are to: 
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Make simple things very simple, but more complex things possible</li>
  <li>Get rid of extraneous symbols and delimiters in the syntax, but...</li>
  <li>Add a little syntactic sugar for collection access and assignment</li>
  <li>Use higher order functions to allow native code to execute more often</li>
  <li>Create a runtime in C++ which is very easy to use and extend</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p>Maybe not in the first versions, but I'd also like to incorporate these later 
    on:</p>
  <li>Pattern matching for method arguments -- for types and values</li>
  <li>Predicate dispatching and support for DBC and metaprogramming</li>
  <li>Coroutines, generators and thread support for multi-processor machines</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simple Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <pre>
1..5 each: i		-- Outputs 1,2,3,4,5,
  put: i, ','

1..5 reduce: t,i	-- Returns 15
  t + i

method double: arg	-- Declares a method
  puts: arg * 2

double: 10		-- Calls 'double:', returns 20

employee.'Mike Austin' = Employee new
</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Basics of Inertia</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Based soley on objects, blocks and messages<br>
    Prototype inheritance, unified semantics for values and methods</li>
  <li>Unary, binary and keyword messages as in Smalltalk<br>
    Self documenting, precendence levels are convenient</li>
  <li>Block indentation like Python or Haskell<br>
    No extraneous {}'s or do end's, reads more like an outline</li>
  <h4>Syntax</h4>
  <p>The syntax is a kind of a mix between Smalltalk and Python. There are three 
    types of messages: unary, binary, and keyword:</p>
  <pre>10 sin		-- unary message, highest precedence
x * 10		-- binary message, mid-level precedence
a pow: 2	-- keyword message, lowest precedence

a pow: x * 10 sin	-- Parsed as "a pow: (x * (10 sin))"
</pre>

  <h4>Datatypes</h4>
  <pre>10					=&gt; an Integer
'Hi'				=&gt;  a String
1..10				=&gt;  a Range
1,3,5,7,9			=&gt;  a List
'A'..'Z','a'..'z'	=&gt;  a List of Ranges
method test: arg	=&gt;  a Method

slot x, y			=&gt; an instance variable
var	a, b			=&gt;  a local variable
object Car			=&gt; an object instance
enum Color			=&gt; an enummeration</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<ul>
  A method is a value that executes code with optional parameters. You begin a 
  method by defining it's name and arguments, followed by a newline and two spaces, 
  or a vertical bar, |, for methods defined on the same line:
  
  <pre>method double: arg	or	define double: arg | puts: arg * 2
  puts: arg * 2</pre>

The syntax for calling a method is very similar to defining:

<pre>
double: 10 =&gt; 20
</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Objects</h3>
<ul><p>There are no classes in Inertia. You create objects that act as prototypes 
  for other objects, or you create standalone objects, or singletons.</p>
<pre>object BankAccount

  slot balance = 0

  method withdrawl: amount
    balance -= amount
	
  method deposit: amount
    balance += amount
</pre></ul>
<h3>More Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <pre>
object Ship: Object

  define collidedWith: object &lt;Rock&gt;
    puts: 'Ship collided with a Rock of size 2'

method factorial: 0 | 1
method factorial: n | n * factorial: n - 1

squares = 1..10 map: a | a^2

y = x in:
  1..10 | -1
  &gt; 100 | 1</pre>
</ul>
