      May 2005 Mike Austin 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day I thought about why I use 
        Google as my primary search engine, and what happened to all the other 
        engines I have used throughout the years. Did they just fade away into 
        nonexistence? No, not all of them. But somehow I became a Googler like 
        everybody else. In this short article, I'll review the top 10 search engines 
        that I use or know about. There are many other search sites of course, 
        but I'll stick to the common ones since this is a short article.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I started using a search 
        engine was around 1996 or so when I worked at Ericsson Components. If 
        I remember correctly, the first ones I used were Infoseek<sup>1</sup> 
        and Yahoo!<sup>2</sup>, and provided basic web searching along with yellow 
        pages and other tools. It seems most search engines today provide searching 
        the web, news stories, images and sounds on their front page search, and 
        will check your query for misspelled words. Many are also portals that 
        provide maps and driving directions, dictionaries, weather information, 
        white and yellow pages and other useful tools. . There are a few that 
        provide unique features such as Ask Jeeves' 'Binoculars', or Google's 
        'Sets'.</p>

      <h2>The Good</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After trying each of the other search engines 
        for a little while, at the end of the day, <b>Google</b> was still my 
        tool of choice. Google works because of it's simple interface, excellent 
        search results, and because it's sponsored ads are off to the side, out 
        of the way of the main results. It also shows sub-page links indented, 
        which helps visualize the results. The only thing I find is lacking is 
        numbered results, and lack of audio searching. I really like engines that 
        number the results &#150; it helps me keep track of where I was when I 
        page back. Google provides an array of other interesting search tools, 
        such as <i>Google Sets</i>, <i>Froogle</i>, <i>Google Linux</i> and more.</p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask Jeeves</b> is also very clean and 
        uncluttered by sponsors. It has the least obtrusive sponsors &#150; they 
        are listed at the bottom of search results. It provides a 'Related topics' 
        column for narrowing results, a nifty 'binoculars' feature to preview 
        a site before clicking a link, and like Google, it shows sub-page links 
        indented. Ask Jeeves provides some interesting tools such as unit conversions, 
        a spell checker, and a movie search tool. I think ask.com would benefit 
        by adding numbered results like some of the other engines.</p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yahoo!</b> was the champion of search 
        engines for quite some time. I used to use it as my primary search engine 
        until I got Googled. It is one of the search engines that have numbered 
        results. If you start at search.yahoo.com instead of the main portal page, 
        it has a very simple interface similar to Google, and the results are 
        excellent. Yahoo is a full fledged portal with tools ranging from mail 
        and calendar to online games, from finance and stocks to auctions and 
        classifieds. Yahoo! also provides premium services such as personals, 
        web hosting and real time financial quotes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't realize how old <b>Dogpile</b> 
        was until I checked the <a href="http://web.archive.org">WaybackMachine</a>. 
        It's a very clean and visually pleasing site that uses other search engines 
        such as Google, Yahoo! and Ask Jeeves to get it's content. I like the 
        numbered results, and the ability to filter from which search engine it 
        is showing. However, the first few links are usually sponsored. The search 
        results and many of the features mirror Excite's, so I believe it is just 
        a front &#150; albeit a better looking front. A whois search for Excite 
        reveals that it's owned by Ask Jeeves. So I guess search engines today 
        are really run by a few conglomerates.</p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSN</b> Search is fairly new to the 
        search engine arena. The results are good, and it provides several ways 
        in which to search. One option is to search their encyclopedia 'Encarta', 
        which is great for fact-finding; another is with their 'Search Builder', 
        where you can set options for age, popularity and narrow or broaden the 
        accuracy of the results. What I don't like is that sponsors are displayed 
        at the top and also on the side. The result links are huge, so only the 
        first 2 results actually show up in an 800 x 800 window.</p>
      <h2>The Not-So-Bad</h2>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exite</b> has been around for a long 
        time. But the first 5 results of my search were sponsored links, which 
        left room for zero relevant results in an 800 x 800 window. Excite now 
        supports searching audio and video, but I don't think these features will 
        redeem the sponsors misuse. It does provide a fun tool called <i>SearchSpy</i>, 
        which lists queries that other people are entering. Dogpile also has this 
        feature, because they are a front, or affiliated somehow with Excite and 
        Ask Jeeves.</p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Like Excite, <b>AltaVista</b>'s 
        first five results are sponsors, with the first relevant sponsor just 
        barely seen at the bottom in an 800 x 800 window. Sponsored results look 
        like normal search results, although there is a tiny label at the top. 
        What I like is the ability to search worldwide or just in the US without 
        having to change my preferences each time.</p>
      <h2>The Ugly</h2>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>With <b>Lycos</b>, the sponsored 
        results are even worse. The first 10 results are all sponsors when I searched 
        for 'dinosaur', and even paging down once only shows the first 4 relevant 
        results. I like the numbered results and the general design, but please, 
        move those sponsors off to the side.</p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AOL</b> wants to pop open a new window 
        to display it's search results. Then it uses a bunch of JavaScript to 
        try to do some fancy sub-searches. Finally, the interface is very different 
        from other search engines that have the categories such as Web, Images 
        and News at the top.</p>
      <p><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earthlink</b> just provided me with 
        a bunch of sponsored results, huge animated unrelated ads, and no ability 
        to search for images, audio or newsgroups that I can see. If you're using 
        Earthlink, you may want to change your start page to one of the better 
        ones discussed above.</p>
      <h2>The Elite</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fun, I decided to make a <a href="/home/projects/google/index.html">mockup 
        of a search engine</a> that I myself would use as a power searcher. Screen 
        sizes have grown over the years, but because of the problems caused with 
        frames, no search engines provide a paned interface. One problem with 
        the use of frames is bookmarking. When you select 'Bookmark This Page' 
        from your browser, you're bookmarking the whole frame set, not the frame 
        you currently have selected. Another problem is where to put the sponsored 
        links &#150; they won't fit in a small frame.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this tool would be designed for power 
        users, the frames issue would not be a problem since you can either drag 
        the link to your bookmarks, or select 'This Frame -&gt; Bookmark' or a 
        similar option. Another approach is to add a bookmark element to html 
        which allows the frameset to specify which page is to be bookmarked. The 
        sponsored links problem can be solved by moving them to the top of the 
        content frame. This actually has a benefit &#150; sponsored ads would 
        be relevant not only to your search results, but to the specific link 
        clicked.</p>
