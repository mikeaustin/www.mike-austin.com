Impulse is a small, dynamic, prototypical programming language with support for multi-methods and
predicate dispatching.  It borrows syntax and semantics from from other languages such as Ruby,
Smalltalk, Dylan, Io, Lua and JavaScript.  I dislike special syntax such as pattern matching and
list comprehension, so Impulse tries to factor these ideas into the language.

\section FEATURES

Impulse is a small, dynamic, prototypical programming language with planned
support for multi-methods and predicate dispatching. It borrows syntax and
semantics from other languages such as Ruby, Smalltalk, Dylan, Io, Lua and
JavaScript along with ideas from functional languages like Haskell and ML.

A core goal is too keep the language, both the implementation and the syntax,
small and lightweight.  Impulse tries to factor special syntax such as pattern
matching and list comprehension into the language using predicates.

FEATURES

  * Prototype Based
    Singletons are easy to create, and objects can change behavior by switching
    their parent prototypes.

  * Small and lightweight
    The core is less than 2,000 lines of lightweight C++, including the VM,
    parser and garbage collector.

  * Reflective and Open
    All objects, including native C++ prototypes can be extended and modified.
    Everything is a first class object.

  * Easily Embeddable
    The language was designed from the bottom up, to provide the most simple
    interface to the runtime.

EXAMPLES

  # Get a list of even numbers between 1 and 10
    1..10 map: n [n is-even?] -> n * n

  # The ubiquitous factorial example
    factorial = n [n == 0] -> 1 \
                  []       -> factorial: (n - 1)

  # A method which takes a <stream> argument
    object <document>
      method print: stream <stream>
        stream write: self
      end
    end

  Compiling should be as easy as "make && sudo make install". Impulse has been
  tested with GCC 4.3.3 on Ubuntu 32/64, GCC 4.3.2-1 on Cygwin, and GCC 4.0.1
  on Mac OS X.
