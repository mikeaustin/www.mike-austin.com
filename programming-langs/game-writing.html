      <h1>What Makes a Game Fun to Play</h1>
      October 2005 &middot; Mike Austin 
      <p>This article presents a brief exploration into what makes a video game 
        fun to play. It has been written to help me work out game ideas, with 
        the intent that it may be useful to others. It concentrates mostly on 
        video games, but other types are mentioned for comparison.</p>
      <h2>Interactivity</h2>
      <p>First and foremost, a game must be interactive, or else it would not 
        be a game. Graphic 'demos' and screensavers are fun in their own right, 
        but interactivity allows a person to be part of the word that is represented. 
        Interactivity can be anything from answering yes/no questions, to virtual 
        worlds where everything interacts with everything else.</p>
      <p>Powerups</p>
      <h2>Game Aspects</h2>
      <p>I see four weighted categories which define the aspect of a game:</p>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="100%">
        <tr> 
          <td bgcolor="#999999" class="table-section"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Coordination</b></font></td>
          <td bgcolor="#F0F0F0">How well can you react and respond to changing 
            events</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="table-section">&nbsp;</td>
          <td>This could be simply moving the mouse over a specific square, to 
            flying a jet at mach 3. Little coordination is required for board 
            games and puzzles.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td height="5"></td>
          <td height="5"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td bgcolor="#999999" class="table-section"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Knowledge</b></font></td>
          <td bgcolor="#F0F0F0">How well do you know the rules of the game and 
            how much do you know about the the game details</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="table-section">&nbsp;</td>
          <td>In trivia games, knowledge is king. For FPS games, knowing the map 
            and the locations of weapons and vehicles is crucial. For chess, it's 
            not only knowing what piece does what, but also all the possible strategic 
            combinations of moves.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td height="5"></td>
          <td height="5"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td bgcolor="#999999" class="table-section"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Capacity</b></font></td>
          <td bgcolor="#F0F0F0">How many things can you keep in your head at once, 
            or, dynamic knowledge</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="table-section">&nbsp;</td>
          <td>While playing chess, how many moves ahead can you think. In a tactical 
            war game, how many things can you remember such as where your opponent 
            is or how many troops you have left.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td height="5"></td>
          <td height="5"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td bgcolor="#999999" class="table-section"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Intuition</b></font></td>
          <td bgcolor="#F0F0F0">How good are you at solving new problems and choosing 
            the right decisions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td class="table-section">&nbsp;</td>
          <td>In chess, when should you sacrifice one of your own pieces. In an 
            FPS game, where is the most likely place your opponent is hiding?</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
      <h2>Attention to Detail</h2>
      <p> They say the devil is in the details, and it's true. Nothing is more 
        boring than a screen that does nothing unless you do something, or a chess 
        board that looks like an ordinary chess board. The accumulation of details 
        is greater than the sum of its parts. Details are things that are not 
        neccessary, but give the game a polished look or play.</p>
      <p> Examples of details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> A multitude of special moves in a fighting game allow the player 
          to keep learning new tactics.</li>
        <li>When Sonic the Hedgehog is left idle, he will tap his foot impatiently.</li>
        <li>In Battlefield 2, loud explosions blur your vision and muffle your 
          hearing.</li>
        <li>In most newer FPS games, as you run, your gun sways left and right</li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Skill Level</h2>
      <p>If you allow the player to set the skill level of a game, he or she can 
        play the game at their own pace. Novices won't be put off by the game 
        being to hard, and experts won't be put off by the game being too easy. 
        As a bonus, a person can replay a game at a higher difficulty level when 
        they have mastered the previous skill level, and it feels like a brand 
        new game. In any event, people like to play with the chance of winning. 
        If you feel chalenged and feel like you're winning, then everything is 
        good.</p>
      <p>What should the differences be between skill levels? For starters, a 
        higher skill level may include more opponents, smarter opponents, different 
        types of opponents, a faster paced play, a shorter time limit, and/or 
        environmental or rule changes.</p>
      <h2>Secret Codes and Undocumented Features</h2>
      <p>xx</p>
      <h2>Feature Unlocking</h2>
      <p>Unlocking new features at certain scores or at experience levels entices 
        the player to keep playing. They are rewarded.</p>
      <p>Examples of locked features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New weapons, vehicles, moves or abilities</li>
        <li>New or enhanced levels</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Rules of Play</h2>
      <p>To make a game enjoyable over months and months of play, there should 
        be </p>
      <p>cooperative teams, everyone for themselves, capture the flag, and variations 
        of these.</p>
      <h2>Gameplay Options</h2>
      <p>Allowing the player or players modify game options is a simple way to 
        add value to the game. Some FPS games allow you to modify the force of 
        gravity, the spawn time between deaths, the effects of friendly fire, 
        and so on.</p>
