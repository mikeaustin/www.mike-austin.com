          The more data and different type of data you store, the more likely 
          you will want to create relationships between tables. This allows you 
          to consolidate your data into one or several different views, allowing 
          you to see more at a glance, and to view it in different perspectives.</p>
        <p>There are four types of relationships you can build:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>One-to-One Relationship</b> - This type of relationship states 
            that one record in one table refers to exactly one record in another.</li>
          <li><b>One-to-Many Relationship</b> - This type of relationship states 
            that one record in one table refers to one or more records in another.</li>
          <li><b>Many-to-One Relationship</b> - This is similar to a one-to-many 
            relationship, but the reference is reversed. It simply changes the 
            perspective.</li>
          <li><b>Many-to-Many Relationship</b> - This type of relationship states 
            that one or more records in one table refer to one or more records 
            in another. This type of relationship requires an intermediate table. 
            Details on this type are discussed further in this section.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is a diagram of a three table and one view model that makes up 
          a simple contact manager:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/contact-manager.gif"></p>
        <p>Notice that the Journal table has a reference to the Contacts table. 
          This order is very important, because where you create the link determines 
          the type of relationship. In this case, it creates a one-to-many relationship 
          - there are many journal entries for one contact, and Contacts is the 
          primary table. If you created a link to the Journal table in the Contacts 
          table, you would have created a one-to-one relationship, which would 
          only allow you to have one journal entry per contact. The Contacts to 
          Company reference is an example of a one-to-one relationship, where 
          one contact can only belong to one company.</p>
        <p>The general rule of thumb is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To create <b>a one-to-one</b> relationship, create a link in the 
            primary table.</li>
          <li>To create a <b>one-to-many</b> relationship, create a link in the 
            table that will have many records to one record in the primary, or 
            master table.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>More On Many-to-Many Relationships</b></p>
        <p>Sometimes you need a many-to-many relationship, where many records 
          in one table reference many records in a second. An example would be 
          Projects-to-People, where multiple people can be working on the same 
          project, but any one person may also be working on multiple projects.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, you need an intermediate table. This table acts 
          as a bridge between the two tables that use a many-to-many relationship. 
          As in a one-to-many relationship, the reference is created in the table 
          that has many records to the one record in the other. The result is 
          to create two references in the intermediate table - one to the first 
          table, and one to the second. Create your views using the base tables 
          and you will have a one-to-many relationship for each primary table.</p>
        <p>Here is an updated Contact Manager diagram that includes a many-to-many 
          reference between the Contacts and Projects tables:</p>
