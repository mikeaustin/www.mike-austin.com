    I worked at Storm8, Inc. for 7 years, starting with taking over front end development of their first HTML based mobile games.
    As we grew, I learned iOS development, then Android, and more recently learned Unity and helped our company grow from 7 people to 250+ people.

    Along the way, I worked on projects ranging from individual games to libraries such as a UI framework written in C++ and OpenGL, and tools and documentation to help develop, profile and debug our games.
    Having been part of a fast growing company, I've learned a tremendous amount of business knowledge, most recently agile principles and practices.
