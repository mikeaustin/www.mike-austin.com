  <h1>Experience</h1>
  <p>
    Working at <a href="http://storm8.com">Storm8.com</a> for 7 years, I started by taking over front end development of their first HTML based mobile games.
    As we grew, I learned iOS development, then Android, and more recently learned Unity and helped the company grow from 7 to 250+ people.

          <li>Designed and implemented an OpenGL UI framework written in C++, used in place of UIKit to improve performance where needed.</li>
          <li>Designed and implemented Storm8 Foundation Library, WorkerQueue to reduce co-routines, and PowerManager to save up to 40% battery life in our games.</li>
          <li>Created GameObject Profiler to reduce co-routine and game-object counts, and Time Profiler to optimize game loading and user experience.</li>
          <li>Implemented autogenerated documentation for our iOS and C# code bases using Doxygen and AppleDoc to promote code sharing and elevate code quality.</li>
          <li>Created and managed Storm8's Code Review Checklist along with other engineering documentation. See <a href="http://mike-austin.com/#portfolio">mike-austin.com/#portfolio</a> for more examples.</li>

  <p>
    I'm passionate about learning, exploring new ideas, and solving problems. I study user interfaces, programming language design and technology in general. Personal projects range from programming languages to smart watch faces. Example projects can be found at <a href="http://mike-austin.com">mike-austin.com</a>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding or designing, I like to watch sci-fi, play guitar and drums, create acrylic PC cases, or drive my FR-S on windy roads. I also love hanging out with my wife and and our puppy: <a href="http://mike-austin.com/#photos">mike-austin.com/#photos</a>.
  </p>  
  <br>
  <p>
    Besides coding and reading about technology, I also like to write about it. You can find articles at <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-Austin-1">quora.com/profile/Mike-Austin-1</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-austin-6b383b4/">linkedin.com/in/mike-austin-6b383b4</a>.
