<h1 style="xmargin-top: 25px; font-size: 25px; font-weight: 500;">Personal Projects</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 25px;">I worked at Storm8 for 7 years, moving from Web to iOS to Android to Unity. Over those years, I still kept up with web standards and new developments, and even used HTML for hackathons and prototypes. Below are projects created recently (March 2017).
  <br /><br />Currently I'm diving into React/Redux, Node, Babel, Webpack, and SASS to become more familiar with the latest technologies. My passion has always been Web development. Prototype, create, deploy.

<h1 style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 25px; font-weight: 500;">Storm8 Confluence Pages</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 25px;">The last few years at Storm8 I focused on tools, libraries and documentation, and promoted general knowledge sharing. Below is a sample of Wiki pages I created during that time.</p>

<section>
  <h1>General Engineering</h1>
  <ul>

      <h2><a href="new/content/portfolio/confluence/Code%20Review%20Checklist.html">Code Review Checklist</a></h2>
      <p>A code review checklist I created for engineering. Another engineer added the server side items.</p>
    </li>
  	<li>
      <h2><a href="new/content/portfolio/confluence/GameObject%20Profiling.html">Unity GameObject Profiling</a></h2>
      <p>A tool I created to help monitor how many coroutines, GameObjects and Update methods are in the current scene. Games are all about memory usage and responsiveness.</p>
    </li>
  	<li>
      <h2><a href="new/content/portfolio/confluence/Visual%20Debugging%20Tools.html">Visual Debugging Tools</a></h2>
      <p>Tools I created to help debug our games. It helps QA, dev, and anyone during play-tests to find component names of anything you see on screen.</p>

    <li>
      <h2><a href="new/content/portfolio/confluence/Structs%20vs%20Classes.html">Structs vs Classes</a><h2>
      <p>A short blog article for engineering about structs (value types) vs classes and when to use them.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<section>
  <h1>Design Documentation</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>
      <h2><a href="new/content/portfolio/confluence/Foundation%20Library.html">Foundation Library Design</a></h2>

      <h2><a href="new/content/portfolio/confluence/WorkerQueue.html">WorkerQueue Design</a></h2>
      <p>A set of classes that allow one coroutine to process many workers, instead of starting many coroutines. Similar to a job scheduler that supports additions and cancelations of tasks.</p>
    </li>
  	<li>
      <h2><a href="new/content/portfolio/confluence/PowerManager%20Design.html">PowerManager Design</a></h2>
      <p>A design of a configurable power manager which allows mobile devices to run at 30 FPS when there is no interaction, or when no animations are running.</p>
